1) Follow reactive manifesto.

Responsible:

System responds in a timely manner if at all possible.

Problems may be detected quickly and dealt with effectively.

Resilient:

The systems stays responsive in the face of failure.

Resilience is achieved by replication, containment, isolation and delegation.

Failures are contained within each component, isolating components from each other and thereby ensuring that parts of the system can fail and recover without compromising the system as a whole.

Elastic:

The system stays responsive under varying workload.

Reactive Systems can react to changes in the input rate by increasing or decreasing the resources allocated to service these inputs.
